How to install and run diarynotes application

Prerequisites:

1. Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.
2. Set up a virtual environment for your project (optional but recommended).
3. Make sure you have PostgreSQL or the database of your choice installed and configured.

Installation Steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ayera-4/Project-Finale.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

   cd notes_ap

3. Install Python Dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Database Setup:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database settings in the `settings.py` file.
   - Apply the initial database migrations:

     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate

5. Create a Superuser (Admin User):

   python manage.py createsuperuser

6. Set up a valid email configuration for email dependent endpoints

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'your-smtp-server.com'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'


7. Run the Development Server:

   python manage.py runserver

   Your application will now be running on `http://localhost:8000/`.
   You can access the Django admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and use the superuser credentials you created in step 5.

8. List of API Endpoints:

    Run "http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/user-view/" to view user endpoints
    Run "http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/notes-view/" to view notes endpoints
    Run "http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/" to view project documentation

7. Access the API Endpoints:
   You can access the API endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).
   Ensure you include authentication tokens or credentials when making requests to protected endpoints.

Note:
Ensure that you have a valid email configuration set up in your Django project settings
if your application relies on sending emails for features like email reminders or sharing notes.
This typically involves configuring SMTP settings.
